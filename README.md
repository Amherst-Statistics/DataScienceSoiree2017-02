materials for Five College Data Science Soiree (Thursday, February 16, 2017)

### Undergraduate Data Science Education Lightning Presentations and Discussion

Thursday, February 16th, 2017  4:30-6:30pm

Amherst College, Converse Hall, 100 Boltwood Avenue, Amherst, MA

Cole College Assembly Hall

hosted by [Andrew McCallum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum) (UMass/Amherst) and [Nicholas Horton](https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/nhorton) (Amherst College)

There has been dramatic growth in the number and variety of data science programs in recent years.  Many questions remain about how to prepare the next generation of students to "think with data".  At this faculty gathering hosted by Amherst College we plan a lively discussion of these issues.  We hope that you and your colleagues can join us (RSVP's solicited below).

On the agenda for February's meeting:

- Brief presentations about existing undergraduate data science education courses and plans, with a focus on entry level courses (including "data science for all" initiatives)
- Updates from the National Academies "Envisioning Undergraduate Data Science" study (http://sites.nationalacademies.org/CSTB/CurrentProjects/CSTB_175246) and "Data Science Post-Secondary Education" Roundtable (http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DEPS/BMSA/DEPS_175092)
- Outline of the PCMI guidelines for undergraduate data science programs (https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/PCMI_flowchart.pdf)
- High level overview of Berkeley's new "Data 8" course (http://data.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/DSEPSummaryReport%20-%20Year%201%20-%20FINAL%20(1).pdf)
- Discussion of possible plans to bring variants of Data 8 to the Five Colleges


### Schedule

* 4:30-5:00pm: a chance to mingle informally over a selection of food and drink before the formal program (Converse lobby)
* 5:00-6:30pm: lightning talks and discussion (Cole Auditorium, Converse Hall)


The presentations and panel discussion (speakers to be confirmed) will be recorded and materials made available after the event.  

The meeting is part of the Five College Data Science Faculty Soiree series of evening meetings we have been having for the past year.  These events, include the February gathering, are generously sponsored by MassMutual. Future meetings will consider other aspects of undergraduate data science education.
